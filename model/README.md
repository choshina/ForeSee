## Abstract Fuel Control

Source: Breach `Ext/Models/AbstractFuelControl.slx`

Note that this model has a long trail of who said it was proposed where:
Adimoolam CAV 17 -> Dreossi NFM 15 ->  Duggirala HSCC 14 (Powertrain benchmark)

Original Source of the Powertrain benchmark seems to be
P. R. Crossley and J. A. Cook. A nonlinear engine model for
drivetrain system development. In International Conference
on Control, volume 2, pages 921â€“925, 1991.

Needs setup:
  val vars = Seq(
    "fuel_inj_tol" -> "1.0",
    "MAF_sensor_tol" -> "1.0",
    "AF_sensor_tol" -> "1.0",
    "pump_tol" -> "1.0",
    "kappa_tol" -> "1",
    "tau_ww_tol" -> "1",
    "fault_time" -> "50",
    "kp" -> "0.04",
    "ki" -> "0.14")
