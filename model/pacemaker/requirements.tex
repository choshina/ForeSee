The requirement for the pacemaker is:

PM = G[0,10](PACE_COUNT <= 15) /\ F[0,10](PACE_COUNT >= 8)

PACE_COUNT is the third output of the model and
time = 10;                  % The simulation duration.

Note that PACE_COUNT is discrete. If this is problematic e.g. wrt. robust semantics,
you can try experimenting with COUNT < 16 and COUNT > 7 (this is not checked so far).

The input ranges for the two input signals are LRL_input=[50 90] and Mode=[1 6].

Instances: TBD
